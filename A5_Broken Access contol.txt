	Remediation
	1. use random generated  ID's containing combination of both letters & numbers
	2. Proper access control-user must be authorized for the information before server provides.

	Impact of IDOR vulnerabilities
	IDOR vulnerabilities seems as “VARIES DEPENDING ON IMPACT” in Bugcrowd VRT because of their impact totally depend your submitted bug.


2. Directory traversal

3. update/delete different user profile-> intecept update functionality of application tamper the parameter ( Example update with new email)
4. static pages & forceful browsing

	GET Documents/1234.pdf

Parameter manipulation & Logic Flaws
Logic Flaws-> are a varient of MFLAC, involving a multi step workflow where an attacker can skip steps of that workflow to his pr her advantage

MFLAC-> missing functionality Logic Control-->Description
If the authentication check in sensitive request handlers is insufficient or non-existent the vulnerability can be categorised as Missing Function Level Access Control.

How Do I Prevent 'Missing Function Level Access Control'?
Your application should have a consistent and easy to analyze authorization module that is invoked from all of your business functions. Frequently, such protection is provided by one or more components external to the application code.

Think about the process for managing entitlements and ensure you can update and audit easily. Don’t hard code.
The enforcement mechanism(s) should deny all access by default, requiring explicit grants to specific roles for access to every function.
If the function is involved in a workflow, check to make sure the conditions are in the proper state to allow access.
NOTE: Most web applications don’t display links and buttons to unauthorized functions, but this “presentation layer access control” doesn’t actually provide protection. You must also implement checks in the controller or business logic.

Example Attack Scenarios
Scenario #1: The attacker simply force browses to target URLs. The following URLs require authentication. Admin rights are also required for access to the admin_getappInfo page.
http://example.com/app/getappInfo
http://example.com/app/admin_getappInfo


But we have created a list about IDOR vulnerabilities’ impacts based on our experience as follows.
P1 – Account takeover, Access very important data (such as credit card)
P2 – Change / delete another users’ public data, Access private / public important data (such as tickets, invoice, payment information)
P3 – Access / delete / change private data (limited personal info: name, adress etc.)
P4 – Access any unimportant data

What is Broken Access Control?
Access control enforces policy such that users cannot act outside of their intended permissions. Failures typically lead to unauthorized information disclosure, modification or destruction of all data, or performing a business function outside of the limits of the user. Common access control vulnerabilities include:

Bypassing access control checks by modifying the URL, internal application state, or the HTML page, or simply using a custom API attack tool
Allowing the primary key to be changed to another's users record, permitting viewing or editing someone else's account.
Elevation of privilege. Acting as a user without being logged in, or acting as an admin when logged in as a user.
Metadata manipulation, such as replaying or tampering with a JSON Web Token (JWT) access control token or a cookie or hidden field manipulated to elevate privileges, or abusing JWT invalidation
CORS misconfiguration allows unauthorized API access.
Force browsing to authenticated pages as an unauthenticated user or to privileged pages as a standard user. Accessing API with missing access controls for POST, PUT and DELETE.

BROKEN ACCESS CONTROL EXAMPLES
Example #1: The application uses unverified data
The application uses unverified data in a SQL call that is accessing account information:


        pstmt.setString(1, request.getParameter("acct"));
        ResultSet results = pstmt.executeQuery();
      
An attacker simply modifies the acct parameter in the browser to send whatever account number they want. If not properly verified, the attacker can access any user's account.


        http://example.com/app/accountInfo?acct=notmyacct
      

Example #2: An attacker simply force browses to target URLs
Admin rights are required for access to the admin page.


        http://example.com/app/getappInfo
        http://example.com/app/admin_getappInfo
      
If an unauthenticated user can access either page, it’s a flaw. If a non-admin can access the admin page, this is a flaw.


How to prevent Broken Access Control
Access control is only effective if enforced in trusted server-side code or server-less API, where the attacker cannot modify the access control check or metadata.

Deny access to functionality by default.
Use Access control lists and role-based authentication mechanisms.
Do not just hide functions.
