Where to look for / How to identify XXE vulnerabilities
1. Application accepts XML directly or XML uploads or insert untrusted data into XML documents which is then parsed by XML processor
2. Look for SOAP based web services
3. XXE attack may leads to DoS attack

XXE attack can by pass authentification & authorization ,Example if an last name field of user profile is replace with value of "c:/windows/win.ini" throught XXE, once user logged in probably he can see reflected data)

How to perform an XXE attaxk
Example if an application forgot password functionality using XML file type, then an attacker intercept the request via Burp suite tool and add below line in request header
<XML version="1.0" url-encoding="utf-0">
<D!OCTYPE attack [
<!ENTITY xxe SYSTEM "file://etc/passwd" ]>
<Forgotpass>&xxe</forgotpass>

CDATA attack:  "character data", whatever specified inside CDATA will not be parsed by xml parser, so attacker can inject malicious java script code

XXE also possible to lead DoS attack: example one ENTITY refers to multiple ENTITIES recursively so it occupies more memory/resources in system
remediation for XXE DoS is limit number of resources

Optical Character Recognition (OCR)
Tesseract is the most accurate OCR
hkhrais@Hkhrais:~$ sudo apt-get install tesseract-ocr
Tesseract is not very flexible about the format of its input images. It will only accept TIFF images
