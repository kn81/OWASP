
Exampes of situations wherelogging is recommended
1.Logins & failed logins
2. Server warnings
3. Enable Error messages
4. Enable Alert threshold

sufficient content in log file
Log file should have good format
integrety constraints on logs ( if log file is modified , able to identify what changes have done)
Response plan- regularly monitor logs
Firewall implementation

If an attacker has installed cryptominer on the server the CPU load for that process will drastically increase
By constantly monitoring the CPU load on the server, such activities can be detected and appropriate action taken
If the attacker starts downloading a lot of data from the server this will show up as an unusual amount of outgoing network traffic
By monitoring network traffic it is possible to detect data extraction and there after prevent it.

Most breaches are discovered after few days,this makes it very clear that many are not using logging & monitoring 
When cleaning up after a hack it is important to know what the attackers have done

Detectify -->tool

Log severity levels
Emergency-> system unstable
Alert- immediate action required
Critical-> Functionality affected
Error-> Error exists that can affect functionality
Warning- Functionality could be affected
Notification- Information about normal events
Information- General system information
Debug- Debug log messages
